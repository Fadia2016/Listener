The Register Page

In this webpage, 
The user will enter a uesrname of 3 characters or more, those caracters are numbers and letters only.
Also, the password should be 10 characters, those characters are numbers and letters only. the password must contain  at least one big letter, small letter, and number.


I used addEventListener to chech each character with the requirment, such as the length of the input, and big or small character.

if the input match the requirment, the listed requirment will turn green, otherwise will turn red

I used tree addEventListener as following:

First addEventListener will be to handle the username
Second addEventListener will be to handle the password
Third addEventListener will be to handle the "password again"
